# GERE – Godot Enhanced Rhythmic Engine

GERE (Godot Enhanced Rhythmic Engine) is an open-source rhythmic game engine built with **Godot Engine 4.5+**, inspired by games like **Friday Night Funkin’**, but designed to be modular, educational and extensible.
The goal of GERE is **not to clone** an existing game, but to provide a clean and understandable foundation for building rhythm-based games and experimenting with timing, audio synchronization and modding systems.
This engine is associated to the game (*coming soon*) built with it that you can find on the [Itch.io](https://europaverse-studios.itch.io/) page.

## Features (current / planned)
- Precise audio-based timing system
- Chart-driven note spawning (JSON)
- Input handling with hit / miss logic
- Modular architecture (core, audio, UI, modding)
- Designed to be extended or embedded into custom projects
- Demo project included

## Why GERE?
- **Built from scratch** to deeply understand rhythm game mechanics
- Focused on clarity over complexity
- Suitable for learning Godot through a real-world system
- **Open-source** and community-friendly
