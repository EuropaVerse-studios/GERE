# GERE – Godot Enhanced Rhythmic Engine

GERE (Godot Enhanced Rhythmic Engine) is an open-source rhythmic game engine built with Godot Engine 4.5+, inspired by games like Friday Night Funkin’, but designed to be modular, educational and extensible.
The goal of GERE is not to clone an existing game, but to provide a clean and understandable foundation for building rhythm-based games and experimenting with timing, audio synchronization and modding systems.

## Features (current / planned)

	•	Precise audio-based timing system
	•	Chart-driven note spawning (JSON)
	•	Input handling with hit / miss logic
	•	Modular architecture (core, audio, UI, modding)
	•	Designed to be extended or embedded into custom projects
	•	Demo project included

GERE is currently work in progress and evolving step by step.

## Why GERE?

	•	Built from scratch to deeply understand rhythm game mechanics
	•	Focused on clarity over complexity
	•	Suitable for learning Godot through a real-world system
	•	Open-source and community-friendly
